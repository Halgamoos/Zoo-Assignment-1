    <p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is a unique and tallest terrestrial animal, known for its long neck and distinctive spotted coat. They inhabit various parts of Africa and use their long necks to reach leaves and vegetation high in trees. Giraffes are herbivores and have a calm and gentle demeanor. Their long legs and necks help them access food sources that are out of reach for most other animals.</p>
