    <p>The lion (Panthera leo) is a large carnivorous mammal known for its majestic appearance and distinctive mane. Lions are native to various parts of Africa and are often referred to as the "king of the jungle." They are highly social animals that live in prides, with a dominant male known as the pride's leader. Lions are known for their strength, agility, and hunting skills, primarily preying on ungulates like zebras and wildebeests.</p>
