    <p>The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest of the big cats and is known for its striking orange coat with dark stripes. Tigers are apex predators and can be found in various parts of Asia. They are solitary animals and are known for their strength and agility. Unfortunately, many tiger subspecies are endangered due to habitat loss and poaching, making conservation efforts crucial for their survival.</p>
